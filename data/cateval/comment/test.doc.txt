Jordan Clarkson is more confident than Michael Jordan ever was
Somebody told me Dray shoots threes like he's wearing a backpack and now I just start laughing every time he shoots
Did JR just pass up an open three to let the defender close so he could take a contested one?
Also of course he splashed it
Lebron has been one of Cleveland's best players so far
Clarkson is not ready for this stage man
The eye balls are an extension of the ball. Bad call. Natural gouging motion.
One thing everyone can agree on, this game is way better than we all anticipated
LeBron straight up able to Palm the ball and control it in the air is incredible.
Why is clarkson even playing?
Jesus Christ he called LeBron Tristan Thompson.
“Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.
*points to Clarkson*
LeBron shooting 90% on 24 points & the game is tied, let that sink in.
How the fuck am I a member of the same species as LeBron James
How is that possible
31 points already on 11-13 shooting. Outrageous
#KLAY WENT FROM HAVING TO GUARD KYRIE TO GEORGE HILL IN THE FINALS LMFAO
Clarkson is killing the Cavs.
What a showdown between Lebron and his arch nemesis clarkson
LeBron: “Fuck your 3rd Quarter”
this is where the chasm is
GS takes curry out, and still can leave KD, Klay and green on the floor
If lebron goes out, you're basically playing Love's timberwolves
The warriors have the worst facial hair in the league
Jordan Clarkson evidently thinks the Lebron-Jordan debate is about him.
Clarkson so trash
I have nothing to say. I'm just really glad I'm alive to watch this.
bron has been amazing tonight
Clarkson is soooo fucking bad lol.
Can we have the TNT crew do the half-time shows instead, please?
lebron and steph playing horse in the finals
holy shit LeBron's eye
Damn Lebron’s eye did definitely look really red in the corner or am I just trippin?
Weak call. Barely scratched the cornea
Oh yeah stabbing his eyes, not a foul
Kd > lebron is just the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard
HOLY FUCK GET CLARKSON OUT THE GAME IM NOT EVEN A CAVS FAN AND HES MAKING ME FURIOUS
I don't know how any basketball fan can call this boring just because it's the same teams we've seen before. This is an awesome game.
31 pts on 13 shots?  Holy fuck lol
Ha clean strip on KD then no call on lebron??
Please Cleveland pull this off. I'm begging you.
Lebron with a historic performance
Nobody will see this because the comments are moving too fast, but have a good day
EDIT: First ever gold I’ve got, thank you friend!
LeBron has hurt me for the millionth time.. but I still wanna see him go bonkers and win this series.  I'd like Love to have a great series too.
Halftime without Shaq, Kenny, Chuck, and Ernie is trash
Honestly looks like the Cavs are happy to not be playing the swarming Celtics defense. Everything looks easy.
clarkson is single handily ruining the cavs flow
Jr with a retarded defensive play? I’m shocked. Dude better change his shoes at halftime
*Lebron shooting 90%*
*JR Smith actually getting rebounds*
*Small cavs players doing a decent job*
*Cavs even increased the lead when Bron got his 21 seconds of rest.*
**tie game**
It’s just not fair
Lebron to Clarkson: “Dude, you’re embarrassing me in front of the Warriors.”
Steve Kerr with a nice adjustment, bringing Wilt Chamberlain into the game to start the 2nd half.
My GOD it is so fun to watch LeBron play
We are watching great basketball, lets babble on about softball who fucking cares
If I'm a Cavs bench player who receives less minutes than Clarkson, I'm leaving in free agency.
Damn, Draymond fucked up LeBron's eye
This is one of the greatest Game 1's I've ever seen.
Well, we haven't missed 27 straight threes yet, so we have that going for us.
LeBron getting shafted
How do you just miss someone hitting someones arm in an NBA finals game in an isolated situation when two people are involved in the play
If the cavs pull this out then they can lose 4 in a row and ill still be impressed
I firmly believe lebron is goat and for some reason this season especially literally no one can stop him
For once i agree with van gundy. Bring on challenges
I like watching Lebron beat teams that aren’t mine
Sit down Clarkson you fucking bum
Clarkson is the Lebron stopper. Not Iggy.
Get Clarkson the fuck off the court lol  he's terrible
Did draymond just yell “f’ing pussy” after that?
Draymond: pokes LeBron in both eyes
"Fucking pussy"
Knew that was going in as soon as he released it.
6 minutes ago: Warriors repeating lol
Now: Yep, gonna be a 7 game series
Clarkson way out of control. Cavs can’t afford to just throw possessions away like that
God damn LeBron is a bad man
Jeff Green been balling out all night great decisions great passes but damn that missed 3 hurts.
George Hill has just set the record for least amount of contact made in a game while picking up 4 fouls.
WHY IS JORDAN CLARKSONS FUCKIN BUM ASS IN THE GAME
Jesus take out Jordan Clarkson and put in anyone else
Jr has some of the lowest iq I have ever seen from an nba player
refs kinda favoring us rn
The Warriors mean-mugging just looks so obnoxious when their run comes off the back of egregious officiating.
I was so siked on this finish but it feels like those two botched calls shifted the game.
Regardless, a much better game that I expected.
Lebron stop passing and take this shit yourself
GO BRON
God I hope Lebron can finish this out. This is one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen.
Not even gonna pretend like i understand that rule
Is Clarkson some guy they pulled out of the stands to play???
Shaq is salivating at that McGee botch right now
dude clarkson..
dang lebron's eye is bleeding
Clarkson is just dumb. Try Hood, Calderon, Cedi, anyone else but him
James is just ridiculous man.
LeSacrifice
Why did it even get reviewed?
He was so far out of the restricted
Oh my god Clarkson just go home
To the dude that said it looks like Draymond has a backpack on when he shoots. I can't un-see that shit now.
LeBron with blood in his eye. What a flopping pussy smh
alright so as long as lebron shoots 100% the cavs can keep it close
Clarkson thinks he's LeBron James right now
Fucking Draymond
JAVALE BACK AT SHAQTIN WITH A VENGEANCE!
LeFuck you threes = back on the menu
Clarkson man wtf
Lebron is that one dude who has a 3.0 k/d and trying to do everything to will his team to a victory while his second best player is some 11 year old trying to quickscope and failing horribly
LMFAOO Someone please gif that Dray defense
Who the fuck said that whenever Draymond shoots it looks like he has a backpack on? You're killin me smalls
Just ridiculous. This is the NBA Finals. Not a high school game. Let’s get some competent officials for fucks sakes
Yo, is Lebron legit gonna play all 48 every game?
Curry's range is basically earth.
Paul Pierce always looks like he just found out his teenage daughter started having sex
ITT: People mercilessly shitting on Jordan Clarkson lmao
If Tyron Lue plays Clarkson a single min in the 2nd half, Its over
Seriously, fuck these guys for only turning up in the 2nd half. They sandbag the 1st half knowing they can do this whenever.
McGee is 100% gassed after 3 min of ball but holy shit where did this come from
Is LeBron bleeding in his eye? Holy shit
Did everyone see LeBrons eye? It was red as fuck, he clearly got poked pretty good earlier when everyone was booing him
HOW DO THEY NOT CALL A FOUL ON THAT MAN. WTF IS GOING ON
LeBron is absolutely incredible
win or lose I'm proud af of this Cavs team for not folding at Oracle
Are you fucking kidding me?
clarkson is just atrocious
I gotta calm down I almost think we have a shot. The third quarter can’t break my heart if I prepare for it
I genuinely think I could do what Clarkson is doing right now
who are the refs this game? they should just be the crew for the entire series.
Steph's going for Finals MVP isn't he?
JR Smith is making Curry's defense look like Kawhi's
Fuck this damn Facebook commercial.
LMFAO McGee
fuck clarkson has it
Clarkson is trash
CLARKSON IS TRASH
Take clarkson and never put him back in
I don't like making negative posts or piling on struggling players but Clarkson is a black hole of productivity out there.
One thing we can all agree on: Clarkson sucks
I like how lebrons rest is basically him just passing the ball rather than scoring
That movie better not fucking kill that dog that good boy didn’t do shit
I know this is a mega long-shot but the Cavs winning this series would be magical
Lebron cant beat 4 all starts and the refs. such fucking bullshit. literally a 5 point swing. fuck you refs
Hope is so painful
KDs burners are gonna be FUMING tonight.
I refuse to believe I am the same species as Lebron, shit's fucked
Coming from someone with no horse in this race, that was a clear slip.  Unfortunate chain of events and hopefully Klay is ok, but that wasn't intentional at all.
Take Clarkson out and put Korver in
Fucking Draymond is such a whiny bitch
Cavs 30 - Dubs 29
NBA Status: **Not ruined (yet)**
I'm not getting my hopes up yet, but damn the Cavs look nice right now
Clarkson is so fuckin bad my god
This timeout literally to bench clarkson
Clarkson is shooting the Warriors back into this game.
man Clarkson is so trash
It was fun guys. Third quarter incoming.
Time to turn off the TV, it's the dreaded 3rd quarter
How nice of Facebook to apologize after they got caught
I'm proud of the Cavs for sticking around so well in the Warriors 3rd quarter. Really impressed with Lebron too. Dude just seems more calm than usual today.
All in all, the Cavs weathered the 3rd quarter as well as possible.
Clarkson just presses R2 at all times
Clarkson is seriously playing better for warriors than kd is
When lebron slams that shit my dick wiggles a little
Every time the warriors pull away I'm thinking "that's it, game over"... But then the cavs somehow pull themselves back in it!
What the fuck. How can you miss that call.
That's what Jordan would have done.
LeBron is short at least 6 MVP's
This is a judgement call that can be changed, I cannot fathom that exists
howcome they can change the block charge rule like this but no other discretion calls?
It was clearly an accident.
“Winning a championship after joining a 73 win team is like losing your virginity to a hooker.” - Abraham Lincoln
If people argue about whether KD Is better than Lebron if he wins Finals MVP I’ll throw a rock at them
not a foul, good no call
LeBron really wants to beat the Warriors
Bench Clarkson now
Clarkson really is the worst player on the court at all times
ok why is Warrior fans booing this....
That was baller as fuck
Holy shit JR is fucking stupid
jr smith is a fcking idiot, why the fck go for a steal when its 1s left???
You cant give Curry a half court shot with 1 second left. Too much space & time, lol.
That's the most Curry shot ever
That was literally the only way Curry gets a wide open 3 and JR did it
remember when paul pierce pooped his pants and left the arena in a wheelchair?
The Proposal is officially the stupidest show I've ever seen.
So unfair the Warriors have Wilt coming off the bench
Oh fuck off Zuckerberg
Jesus Christ LeBron
LeBron is a God wtf
I think Bron's getting a little tired
Clarkson is soooooo bad holy shit
clarkson doesn't pass and always takes bad shots, just cut him
Lebron red eye, LeTerminator
I think it’s not a bad idea to attempt Hood for a few minute. I mean, he can’t possibly do worse than Clarkson.
Unless he declines to go in the game, then I would just look like an idiot.
Since JVG is too slow to understand this simple concept I'll explain it for the rest who agree with him:
Korver is thinking "I get hit on the arm like that on 30% of my shots and yall never call it this is bull shit"
that's why players bitch about obvious fouls
THESE REFS
Yo wtf are these refs looking at
Are you fucking kidding
Cavs getting robbed by some bad calls
As soon as Steph crossed over there, you knew it was a bucket..
lebron is the greatest human being of all-time don't @ me
LeBron James looking like the terminator with one red eye.
Is that red mark on LeBron's eye from when Draymond got him earlier in the game?
"Did you see that play?" What a dumb fucking question lol.
Oh boy, I’m sure this won’t be controversial.
Oh my fucking GOD TAKE CLARKSON OUT
edit: and Nance seriously just looked off Lebron to pass to Clarkson jfc
TAKE OUT CLARKSON YOU FUCKING TILAPIA LOOKIN HEADASS
LeBron could get murdered on live TV and yall would say hes being a bitch lmao jesus
This is a team versus a player right now
these bullshit ass refs
Lebron got fucked on 2 calls in a row lmao
Fortunately, I'm seeing more people calling anyone who thinks its intentional idiots than I'm seeing people who think it's intentional.
Jesus, Clarkson is laughably bad. Not that he was good for the Lakers, but he does look significantly worse on the Cavs.
Jesus christ, Durant has been fucking awful.
LeBron playing great but the real story is the supporting cast. They're really surprising me
Bron looks great, full of energy after that huge break. They need to steal this one cause he wont have this kind of rest again.
Lmao jordan Clarkson is hot shit
Clarkson please stop shooting
Who the fuck does clarkson think he is
Clarkson you bum
Soft ass call there.
I for one am SHOCKED that JR went for an idiotic, ill-advised steal so he could chuck up a half court buzzer beater
CAVS AT HALFTIME
PLAYERS: What you want us to do coach?
LUE: What you want them to do LeBron?
LeBRON: WHERE THE FUCK IS BUGS BUNNY WITH THAT SECRET STUFF???
JR Smith top 3 dumbest people in the history of life.
LeBron playing amazingly and an invisible KD and it's tied at the half. Holy fuck.
Image if LeBron played like Durant this half. Cavs would be down 20.
Paul Pierce‘s voice gives me ass cancer
That's the Shaqtin MVP i know and love.
BLOCKED BY THE RIM
HAHA. JaVale is amazing. Blocked by the rim with no one around him.
I personally don’t understand how people say lebron isn’t the GOAT at this point
Lebron has 36. The rest of the Cavs have 37...
Why is Clarkson in the game.
Lebron bloodshot eye from when draymond poked him in the face
Calderon and Korver > clarkson and JR.
Cmon Lue
Ty (to Cavs Players not named Bron): I left my clipboard in the locker room. Can you get it?
Ty Lue locks the players in the locker room as they enter. Only plays Lebron in the 4th Quarter
brons eye is fucked
Korver has been dreadful
LMAO draymond tried to guard with his legs
Draymond will kick you and not give a fuck lol
Whatchu know about Pusha T, Jeff?
Why do the Warriors always get bailed out by the fucking refs
“Guys relax, we up”
I've always said that the national anthem didn't have enough drum fills
You know what would be awesome? A Jurassic World movie where the all the humans get eaten in the first 30min and then it's 2hrs of nothing but glorious dinos
LeBron set the bar so high in game 1 that people are actually shitting on 15 Points, 8 ast and 7 Reb at Half
that MVP chant for JR is the most brutal shit I've seen from a crowd in professional sports lol
**[LeBron finally gets an easy layup, pulls the score within 7]**
"Oh shit, Cavs finally might have something cooking here."
**[Curry immediately answers with a fuck you three with an arc high enough to go over the Empire State Building]**
Love's inability to hit his threes is destroying any shot the Cavs have at winning this series. These are wide open looks he is missing.
“He (Draymond) just agreed with the call which is a very special moment”lol breen
"And then something happened - we sold all your information for profit, disregarding all consequences" -Facebook
*Steph throws ball*
*It goes in*
What even is the point of basketball
Warriors are the best 3 point team of all time? Easy, just force them to shoot easy 2s all night. Brilliant coaching by Lue
Everyone on the Cavs updating JR on the score. #teamwork
Why does LeBron, the largest Cav, not simply eat the other Cavs?
bruh are they chanting MVP for JR? lmao
“Guys relax, we up”
- JR
Crowd cheering JR Smith during introductions is absolutely hilarious and cruel.
Who in the damn hell gave KLove that horrible fade?
I'm upvoting everyone shit talking Clarkson. This fucker is unbelievable
"The Meg" is the worst name for a Shark move you could possibly imagine
MVP chants for JR is too much, we have reached peak meme
Nba got to cut those fucking calls out. Offensive foul imo
I’d rather watch Shaq and Barkley get into ego arguments than watch Paul Pierce
You either call it on Bell early or on Lebron when they did call it. Just doesn’t look right having Lebron toss him and then Bell pick up the foul
The drummer lady was sitting for the anthem
Anyone else despise this Facebook commercial?
LMAO mvp chants i gotta admit thats too good
I like how JVG just confirmed make up calls are a thing
makeup calls dont solve anything smh
Why not just call the foul really late? At least it would’ve been right instead of that tipped ball call lmao
Refs doing an awesome job keeping it close so far. Let's hope they can keep it up
Complaint about refs. Complaint about fans complaining about refs.
I want to defend Jordan Clarkson, but I just can't.
Does Kevon Looney only work on shoulders at the gym?
THAT'S PASS INTERFERENCE
Kendrick bouta ice those knees after the game from standing up
Foul on Green and he agrees with it.  This is a very special moment.
Lebron has 27 points right now. If he matches his 51 points in the next 8 minutes, Cavs should win handily.
LMAO HE SAID BALL DONT LIE
Warriors fans aren’t even that bad. They have arguably the greatest team ever and they’re hardly out here letting you know. Just wait until the Celtics get healthy and a bit older. Then you’ll be sorry r/nba
KLAY IS SHOOTING 0% WHEN CEDI IS ON THE COURT
I get so annoyed when they show the Cavs bench acting tough when LeBron hits a big shot. Like shut up, not only was that not you... you are actively making LeBron play full games cause as a team you suck.
I the only one who keeps getting thrown off by the away team wearing whites. I realize they've done it all year but it's hard to get used to for some reason. Whenever I picture LeBron playing at oracle I can only envision him in a navy blue jersey and yellow armband
Holy shit Kevin Love's rim protection is literally non-existent.
WHY IS CLARKSON ON THE COURT?!
im a pretty casual fan but clarkson is literally the worst player ive ever watched
what lol
They just panned to Iguodala like he just got Bell laid
lebron was literally being tripped lmao
It's crazy that most people in this thread are too young to really know Carlos Santana. OG guitar god.
jesus christ just call the foul i hate this bullshit about them not admitting they fucked up a call and either just acting like nothing happened or forcing some nonsensical make up call
Santana will never not be cool. Total bad-ass.
JR Smith in the huddle: “tie game fellas we just need one stop”
>Korver took JRs breath away
Kyle tried to kill him
This ref blind af
One time out left all fourth quarter.  Lue really is fucking terrible with TO management
Steve Kerr doing Lebron a solid by calling him a timeout lol
Shaun Livingston and Javale McGee: 11-for-11, 22 points
The entire Cavs bench: 2-for-11, 9 points
Kardashians on Family Feud. Humanity is too far gone to be saved.
theres a foul somewhere
but it aint on ty lue
He agreed with the call, this is a very special moment
No. Fucking. Way. Holy shit
Curry is on a 3 point barrage
LMAO mvp chants
“Old school refereeing”
I’m high as fuck and I’m imaging a shark the size of a blue whale fuck that’d be bad
How is that not a foul???
My jaw is on the floor
Im a warriors fan, but how the FUCK do you miss that call. Really blatant lol...
Fucking David West is drilling threes but the bums on Cleveland can’t hit one lmao
Lebron can’t win with these cats
Damn LeBron just threw him down there.
Lol that dunk made no noise
Probably the worst movie title ever
Get clarkson out of the game holy shit
Ridiculous call
refs aren't rigged they're just awful
“Guys relax, we up”
JR
Kendrick Perkins like "This is my moment!"
It just hit me that Nick Young is gonna get a ring.
No fucking way
S K Y F U C K E R
Oracle confirmed wavy with Touch the Sky
holy shit that is a WEEAAAAAK call. also, these announcers oblivious to the bonus
Poll: should Clarkson be in the NBA?
Lebron has 15-8-7 and it feels like he was mediocre. It's not easy being the king.
Lmao this Lonzo commercial
I guess James can rag doll bell now
Even when warriors are making shots, Cavs have an advantage in rebounding. Its what keeps them in games.
PATHETIC defense from the Cavs.
What a cluster fuck of a call, call the foul or don’t.
OLD SCHOOL REFEREEING LMAO
What a waste of an NBA season
Does anyone else hate that fucking "relax big guy" Nissan ad as much as I do????
Trade LeBron, dishonorably discharge Clarkson, commit JR Smith to Arkham Asylum, build around Cedi Osman
Jvg freaked me out the fuck was that
No space to land. What the fuck.
Klay is by far the most clutch player on the dubs
Klay is way too good.  Warriors are lucky to have him.
say head of steam one more goddamn time
KD watching himself on TV is the most realistic part of the commercial
Damn. Del Curry is a lucky man
Lebron looking like the Terminator
When Lue put Clarkson in Cavs lost.
I have no idea why he gambles on Clarkson figuring it out, when he has been ass the WHOLE playoffs, as opposed to a couple games
Lmao the MVP chants are great
Van Gundy has a good point
Fuck you clarkson
Clarkson is more of an mvp than JR
This literally like chess vs. checkers, the Warriors players have so much more versatility.  Cavs played great defense for the whole 24 only to give up a contested mid range jumper by Livingston.
Wtf is this commercial?
Personally I feel like ass-eating per-capita (or AAPC) is probably higher. I know that I'd be on board with eating ass if I knew the butthole in question was like, powerwashed at any given moment.
Klay is disgusting.
REFS
Remove JR
Lmao i agree warrior fans. Refs u suck Terrible on both sides
THAT...THAT'S JOHN CENA'S MUSIC!
Man this uncle drew movie is about to be the worst $15 I’ll spend in a while
Love hits back to back threes. the great coach Ty Lue benches Love
This Curry hot streak brought to you by Kendrick Perkins.
Bron caught his own bucket lmao
Draymond fucked LeBron’s eye so bad FaceID doesn’t work anymore
ok yea this is like fuck you 3
That was an actual skyfuck right there.
All you can do is laugh at some of the shots he hits
“Alright guys, terrible first half but we are only down by 3, let’s f’n win this.”
-JR Smith to his team in the locker room
How tf you don’t give LeBron the foul call but you pick a T for Lue out of that. Trash reffing
how the fuck is clarkson getting any time
Clarkson is straight garbage. Send him back to where he came from.
If LeBron was LeCoach you can bet your ass Clarkson would only enter the court to mop the floor
cheap way to get a foul
In b4 300 comments about how that was on purpose
Lol Jalen looking like he is rembering that 81 point game Kobe put on his dumbass
Starting Javale was a fantastic adjustment by Kerr
I wish the tnt crew could  commentate the finals
"ALMOSTATRIPLEDOUBLE" - JVG
Lmao a movie about a man saving his family in a tall ass building for about 2hrs. Can Hollywood can be any more ridiculous
BBB has a add wow
*green agreed with the call this is a very special moment*
How tf do you play 82 games and not realize that you have to box out fucking Dray every play? Brutal.
Threezus christ
........clearly, physics is rigging this game for the Warriors.
OH MY GOD, WTF WAS THAT
MVP CHANTS FOR JR OMEGALUL
cavs defense is so ass lmao
People complaining about refs
People complaining about complaining about refs
Is Tyronn Lue having an affair with Jordan Clarkson? Cause I don't see any other reason he would keep playing him.
Lebron has 15-8-7 and it feels like he was mediocre. It's not easy being the king.
What the fuck are these refs doing
Idiot refs that was on Lebron
LEbRon gEtS nO cALls
“He just agreed with the call, This is a very special moment” Bahaha that’s awesome.
What the fuck how is that not a foul
Who's that idiot with the Golden State "we still believe" sign? In spite of what?
right in front of your fucking face how do you miss that call?
Good thing I got high.
These threads are always so angry. Basketball is fun y’all
Pizza Hut acting like getting your order right is going above and beyond.
The NBA Finals are life and I’m Jordan Clarkson
wait... his foot was totally on the line lol
Damn, that's a rough call on Klay
is that like Lebrons 3rd missed layup?
All we need is 50 from bron in the second half and we’re good
That guy prepared his whole life to catch that ball at halftime on this big a stage. Good job!
ASSHOLE REFS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEVIN LOVE’S HAIRCUT
screw "east west", let's just have the playoffs with the top 16 best records
What the fuck refs
Refs are killing the NBA
Cavs still fighting. Win or lose, very impressive.
durant’s beard is so bad.
They almost didn't call that foul LOL
That's demoralizing -- Green misses an open three and turn around to watch David West hit one.
lmao... lebron just bullied the fuck outta bell, lol.
Mike Breen talking shit lmao
I fuck with it I need the name of this song
Make LeBron and Curry captains and have them pick from the rosters and this series is interesting
LeBron just like fuck this shit
Cavs out of timeouts with over 5 minutes remaining. Lue for COTY.
Everytime LeBron does something amazing the Cavs go and play the most atrocious defense and let Curry do something great...
LMAO he jumped into him wtf
Draymond Green's face is just permanently stuck in "HOW IS THAT (NOT) A FOUL?!" face. He just looks like that when he goes out to restaurants
Notice how the announcers say nothing about that bullshit foul?
Jr smith looking relaxed so far, as he should be since they have a 1-0 lead after game 1
hoooly shit they gave a tech too...wow they couldnt have messed that up worse. wow
I swear I will fight each and every one of you who disses Santana. That man is a god.
Jesus LeBron's eye looks fucked up.
LOL, MVP!
MVP chants lmao
LMAO MVP
MVP lol
Damn that was cold.
lol MVP chants for JR
Just let curry walk right to the basket LMFAO
"Mistakes happen"
Cedi got playing time in the finals what a time to be alive
Anyone who thinks the NBA would have a reason to rig this series for anything other than reaching 7 games is hilarious
That would be a long two, Mike.
Don't they mention the intentional foul thing every game?
Jordan Clarkson is like if Andre Roberson decided to start isoing and shooting all the time
Lue please stop playing Clarkson
How is Clarkson in the NBA?
Clarkson is so bad he doesn't even know how bad he is
Those refs reaaaaally didn't want to call that for Klay
That’s some dumb shit
I don’t like that play from Klay at all.
LOL, JVG with the ball don’t lie.
The NBA Replay Center is so defensive lmao
You'd think Livingston could push that out a couple feet and be a three point machine. It's so automatic
if we would hit an open shot
Klove misses wide open 3, Curry hits wide open 3. Gotta make open shots
if they change the rule on that 3 twitter going to be crying the league rigging it against houston for GSW
kevin love and open 3s
Gotta love when Lebron makes an amazing play only for love to brick the open 3 haha :(
How TF is that a foul on Klay
Lebron needs to pretty much play like a massive ballhog and shot jacker at this point. They have no chance beyond that.
Kevin Love in the first half: 7 points, 7 rebounds, 1 assist, 1 turnover. 2/10 from the field, 0/2 from three.
I’ve said it since game 1 but I’m forcing the Warriors offense to run through anyone but Curry. His buckets just feel like they mean more than anyone else’s. They extend their offense and get Oracle way into it. Fuck it, bring on KD.
Me and all my friends legit thought Jalen Rose was a wax figurine...
No way is Kevon Looney 22 wtf
Definitely feels like the refs are favoring the Cavs, but I don't think it's quite as big as it seems \- the Cavs aren't contesting Warriors layups so there is less probability of a Cav foul. Aside from that Warriors are playing much better than the Cavs
Paul Pierce is terrible as an analyst
Why did jalen rose look like a wax figure before going into halftime?
McGee has outscored Love in the first half, dude's gotta step it up big time.
Lebron has 15-8-7 and it feels like he was mediocre. It's not easy being the king.
did dray say "move your ass out the way" lmao
Curry really doesn't get foul calls
Jeff Van Gundy once coached the Knicks to the NBA Finals. That´s how old he is.
Jeff Van Gundy and Larry David are basically the same person
Bruh this jank ass Cleveland squad gonna take three years off LeBron's total career making him do this shit himself.
Purge me now
Refs are shameless
*AND* he got a T?
I don’t know why they’re not trying to get Klay to commit his 4th foul. They didn’t do it game 1 and they’re not doing it now.
I will give Lorenzo credit for having a sense of humor.
BUT HOW CAN KD BE WATCHING GAME IF HE IS PLAYING GAME?
That commercial transition was dope
Refs suck on both sides
Um, did Bell get Rooked?
So many Cavs role players have been unfathomably awful that it's easy to forget that Green has sucked ass too
Lmao Nance JR on skates
That Perkins trash talkin' got curry triggered
That altercation backfired on the cavs
LeBron looks like a disappointed father.
Green agreed with 2 fouls already. He raised his hands before this one too.
WHAT SONG IS THAT GUYS
This is my type of jam baby
i love JVG
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SHOT!!!!!
SKY = FUCKED
Skyfucker is my fav player to watch ever
even salty mark jackson thought that was sick
curry is the goat shooter
Oh boy, JR Smith must be feelin super duper dumb now... if he somehow didn't already
Rofl dubs fans chanting mvp for Smith that cold as ice
Looks like curry pressed "Y" too early
Oh shit refs you’re fucking up
I think the refs just refused to believe Steph missed by that much
Warriors fans aren’t even that bad. They have arguably the greatest team ever and they’re hardly out here letting you know. Just wait until the Celtics get healthy and a bit older. Then you’ll be sorry r/nba
No-call for Curry, Touch foul for Lebron.
Story of the game
This is why everyone bitches about the refs
Wow absolutely terrible call
Lebron is so done with this league. He's taking his talents to China with Jimmer the GOAT
You give Cleveland a technical but after every call Draymond Green is losing his mind
The officiating has gotten so bad in the NBA it's making me want to stop watching.
"YouTube Tv is here for practically the same price as basic cable."
lebron traveled before the foul
Not much contact on that one.
If i had $1 for every open look the Cavs missed. I could buy the Cavs
Jordan Clarkson you are so garbage buddy. I don't know whether you are nervous or just trash but you are hurting your team every time you try to score. Just play defense and do the little things.
What the fuck refs.
Warriors by 30+ tonight
7/7 FG
They need to pass a law that bans commercials featuring players who have been eliminated from the playoffs until the Finals are over.
Did kevin love cut his own hair with a tiny mirror?
coach perkins sole responsibility tonight is whispering the score into JR's ear during timeouts. Money well spent
i’m into getting the calls right
lebrons eye... yikes
Clarkson sits and Cedi comes in. What a beautiful sight.
Draymond really does shoot like he’s got a backpack on like someone said earlier. HAHA
CLARKSON STOP YOU MOTHERFUCKER
#CLARKSON NEEDS TO FUCK OFF FUCKING GARBAGE SCRUB
How could Hood possibly be less effective than Clarkson?
Can anyone prohibit clarkson from taking this shots?
Lol ball don't lie
That's not a foul
Klay Thompson threw himself into a player that was vertically jumping. A natural shooting motion by Klay Thompson wouldn't have resulted in a foul
"Ball don't lie" oh my sides
Ball don’t lie
this shooting foul crap has been happening for years now, and they still havent fucked adjusted to it?! this league's officiating is fucking pathetic and theres no denying it at this point
Was just about to say 'Cavs only down by 4', went out to the balcony to fart, came back, down by 11....
If they leave Shaun open would he post up the air to get the turnaround?
Hart keeps putting out movies
This is a sweep. LeBron is WAY too tired
Guess I'm slow, but I just realized how weird it feels that Cavs are in the white jerseys tonight. When I'm paying attention to something else, and glance over at the game, I keep assuming they're GSW
Anyone else still bummed at "The Finals" logo redesign?
James after this game
James: yo Harden come by tomorrow and show me how you get them fouls
I'm so stoked for next years final of Golden state vs whoever Lebron signs with
can't believe people gonna be hating on the warriors even after they get us all a free taco
LeBron and the Cavs almost had the infinity gauntlet off of Kerr’s hand but then JR went and pulled a Starlord and fucked everything up.
It feels like Lebron is having a bad game. Then I realize he's close to triple double already....
announcers are already bored
When the Warriors have the ball, all players are scrambing to get open. When Cavs have the ball all players freeze in one position and wait for Lebron to make a move. Cmon man
I have a lot of respect for the Cavs. I thought they were done.
Lmao how the fuck is that not a foul
LeBron looking at the refs like they JR
That’s fucking ridiculous
Jesus christ so LeBron gets his knees taken out and the warriors get a free throw. Sick reffing
These refs are absolutely trash
It what way is that not a foul?????
No Foul is literally impossible there
Curry gives Bron no room to land and then he gets to shoot a free throw on the other end.
If anything garbage calls like that one prove it's not rigged. The NBA would want the Cavs to win this one. It's just a terrible call.
That Youtube TV commercial is next level
Weird how Van Gundy and Jackson aren't losing their shit over this call
You keep thinking, JR HAS to have a good game at some point. And so you wait, and wait, and wait, and before you know it, the season's over.
When david west hits a 3, you know its gg
idk what game you guys are watching but the refs are fucking awful on both ends.
Perkins is the drunk uncle at your BBQ.
Kendrick perkins on the bench in a suit trying to talk shit. Old man needs to stfu
Better get Nance off of Curry
Man its just embarrassing watching the rest of Cavs during to score
Wow Korver...Lebron even has to make all the 3s himself
Curry's mom is significantly hotter than his wife.
After Lebron leaves this is gonna be one of the most brutal rebuilds in history. Literally everyone on the team is either old, bad, or both.
If the Cavs are gonna have a chance at a game right now, they better buy up some courtside seats for some top tier foot models to throw Curry off.
Jason statham in another terrible movie? I am shocked
Is that the person illegal grilling in the park as the background?
Korver has 1 made 3 pointer this series with 30 minutes played ...
just let bron iso for the rest of the game fuck it
*Every* time the Cav's make a shot Mike Breen goes, "And the Cavs are back within X". Every. Single. Time.
What the actual fuck Steph?!
YOu have GOT to be FLIPPING kidding me
Curry has cheat codes turned on
This is Stephs Finals MVP to lose
Curry is legitimately unfair.
JR Smith 5 points in 29 minutes with a -5 +/-. He has taken Iggy's spot as the 5th best player on the Warriors.
***[Korver misses from 25 feet out]***
***[Korver misses from literally directly below the basket]***
Don't worry, Lebron's ligaments will be 100% healed in about 10 seconds from now.
I can't remember the last role McConaughey played where his character washed his face.
LeBron: injury occurred initiate tie laces tighter protocol
JR: *Wow these Warrior fans are hella nice*
"they either have to call a time out or get a sub"
"or just get up"
lolol
Let's go to Steve Javie
"Whatever the refs called, they were right."
Crowd scared to “air ball” Durant after seeing what he’s already done to them
LMFAO they censored the fan “FUCK YEAH”
Remember when Sheed was kicked out for looking at a ref for too long?
"Let's bring in Steve Javie to confirm whatever the fuck the refs decide to do in a continued PR move by the league to make the refs not look so terrible."
JVG talking bout some “take a foul or take a charge” bitch that’s a 6’8 260 monster coming at me I’m not taking a charge I want to live
Boy oh boy the Cavs are looking great out of the gate. I can't wait for the Warriors to win by 15.
Curry getting into early foul trouble in Cleveland? An absolute classic.
Hood looks like fuckin chamillionaire
Points by starter:
Draymond - 4
KD - **24**
McGee - 2
Curry - 2
Klay - 5
I had the hiccups for 2 hours until Lebron threw that alley to himself. It was so insane that they stopped. Not even playing.
If all you need to do after twisting your able is tie your shoe a little tighter then I'm going to footlocker right now to buy some new LeBrons
It's almost as if Rodney Hood has been better than Jordan Clarkson this whole time!
"Or just get up......." Haha truth
Can you imagine a normal person take a full speed shoulder from Lebron? I would have flown into the first row and had to leave the game in a stretcher.
Kerr: Shaun GTFO
ESPN announcers are literally the value brand TNT. I wish the finals were with TNT always.
Holy shit I'm so sick of these movies with The Rock that look like they should come free when you buy Affliction or Tapout clothes
The Cavs haven't shot a FT this half, right?
Am I watching the Cavs broadcast or the national one?
RIP Jordan Clarkson’s minutes
Finally Hood getting minutes instead of Clarkson.
Javale McGee is playing meaningful, productive Finals minutes on a team that is probably going to win a ring. I NEVER want to hear that I'm unqualified for a job I apply for ever again
ok that's bs foul
I want to see a ref just lose it one of these days and flip out.
\#HotTake: Kyrie got "hurt" so he could concentrate on the Uncle Drew movie
Was this not the most predictable start ever lol
Kevin Durant just told Nick Young “Don’t fuckin’ foul nobody!”.
lol lebron freaking the fuck out and it definitely went off his leg
was jeff van gundy just complaining about how the refs have to make a call... that they made?
I'm stressed
Holy crap Durant is doing some work. 12 points 4-4 with 7 rebounds
Cavs have got to figure out a way to trick jr into thinking hes always playing at home
30 for 30: How The Warriors Dominate the 3rd Quarter with Yoga and Friendship
Tristan "how can I make my shot even more difficult" Thompson
KD must have told Curry he cant win with him.
Someone earlier said KD game 3 last year felt same. There it is.
[Is it just me or does KD look like Tyrone Biggums when he shoots FT?](https://78.media.tumblr.com/9d395408e31d63707cf0bc27688575a9/tumblr_n1gw3s8ymZ1sikq5fo1_250.gif)
Facebook commercial. Drink!
LMAO "FUCK YEAH"'
Lol that wasn’t that much contact tbh
Green isn't a flopper AFAIK, so he gets the benefit of the doubt. But that didn't look THAT bad on replay.
For some reason, and I have absolutely no reasoning for this, but I feel like Kevin Love will one day end up on Survivor.
If the Warriors win this game with Steph mass producing bricks
Sure, okay Lebron. Just self oop in a fucking NBA Finals game.
This White Boy Rick looks good
"he's a proven scorer"
"He's averaging 4 points per game"
This is an NBA finals team
RIP 12 point lead
Im fucking sick of these facebook ads. The audacity..... Just shut the fuck up and accept that you oversaw the exploitation of your users. It wasn’t just “spam”
Rockets lost the series because of that statefarm commercial
Lol Apple trippin
Wow this commercial
Cavs have such bad team spirit. Anytime anything goes wrong, you could see the life sucked out of the team.
Really impressed by Hood' performance today..
Who knew Rodney Hood was better than Jordan Clarkson /s
I love how hood is doing some basic things and providing a change of pace and energy off the bench... You know like what role players are supposed to do... And Cavs look considerably better. That's how little LeBron needs someone to step up
O/U 8% on RottenTomatoes for Uncle Drew?
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
“Or just get up”..... omfg lol
Damn.  Lol
Did a sniper shoot him from the rafters in the middle of that screen?
sitting courtside.. steph pulls up 2 ft away from u.. he splashes a 3 and splashes u with sweat.. bruh its like paradise.. how can u even guard steph when hes the same color as the court.. only see him when he shimmies.. maybe he wud dance w me.. on the jumbotron bruh i might weep.. sorry im not sorry pops..
I don't get it. If I roll my ankle, I'm not playing anymore and I'll probably limp for like a week. Bron just regenerates the muscle and keeps moving. Fucking amazing
Lol Lonzo making fun of himself is great
At least Clarkson is getting a DNP
Well.... a 2 deficit and lebron got a minute of rest. that's a win?
Steph lettin it splash in the toilet
Ty Lue's face looks like he was caught off guard by a roast and can't think of a comeback.
LeBron looks fucking exhausted
KD carrying harder than LBJ tonight
KD fucking
That's just not fair
Lmao I’m rooting for cavs but that was soft as baby shit
Give him finals mvp just for that dunk.
just need a 26 point cushion going in to the 3rd
Wow what a bitchass flop
Korver better from 25 than 2 lol
Lebron is the only player who knows what a layup is i think
I like how Facebook puts out this ad as if they're not the ones responsible for Facebook becoming garbage.
Waiting for Facebook to make an apology ad for spamming their apology ad
lebron has metal bones or some shit
Surprise. Slightly rolled ankles actually activate Lebron’s trap card.
I don’t care who you’re cheering for.....these refs just flat out suck.
Actually been super impressed with Tristan Thompson's defensive awareness. Making great decisions.
People shared and came together. Then something happened. We sold your personal information to Chinese companies.  Even ones banded by the US Government.  But don't worry, that's going to stop and we will regain your trust...unless we get caught red handed again.
shout out to everyone enjoying the game not mad about something
love him or hate him KD is straight carrying the warriors right now
what in the ever-loving fuck is that ad?
Ty Lue: “Bron do that backboard thing again”
You could literally hear Cavs fans yelling at JR after that missed 3
Rodney Hood should have started the 2nd half.
Bench JR, it's so obvious
Curry dropped a deuce in the last 2 minutes
Every bucket Hood scores in this game is probably worth at least $2mil on his next contract.
I've never seen Curry this cold. Reminds of Ray Allen in 2010; set the Finals record for 3's made in a Finals game (8) during Game 2, then went 0-8 from 3 in Game 3.
Was is that asshole in the Camry speeding through the forest and tailgating an RV?
Dont worry guys Jr smith will complete his brick neighbourhood soon
"Draymond has to be careful"
Nance pulls down Green. No call.
These refs...smh. I don't even think it is a conspiracy anymore, I just think they have no fucking clue what they're doing.
10:25 local time and it’s only half. On a fucking Wednesday. Dumbest shit ever
This animoji commercial would look great on acid
Draymond is 2/718727 on 3s in this series
LMFAO what a terrible call
Awful foul call
It’s crazy how home court can change the feeling of games. It feels like a 20 pt advantage for Cleveland but it’s only 8 which we know is pretty much zero against the warriors lol
That coke movie actually looks pretty entertaining.
my god livingston midrange is money
nance literally pulled draymond down lmfao
Watch lebron come back 2x stronger in a few mins
Kawhi is out fucking a year when his ankle turned like that from the ogre Zaza.  Hes not human
Such a privilege to play with JR
LeBron seems to be avoiding jumpers, specifically threes. It was clear last game too.
I wonder if his eye is fucking up his depth perception.
LeBron bumps Curry before he tangled with him lol
Durant trying to steal FMvp.
love him or hate him KD is straight carrying the warriors right now
So steph cant throw it in the ocean. Klay has been basically silent, and the Warriors just went on a run to take back the lead lol.
...are they seriously following curry to the bathroom?
If you put old ass players in the uncle drew movie it defeats the premise of uncle drew
What is with Curry? There's no way he's injured. 1-14 is unacceptable from a superstar on the road.
Lebron shoved iggy first...
Nba is so rigged lmao. Rooting for cavs but wtf was that foul to get them in the bonus?
40 points on 21 shots... my guy, that is unreal.
Wow, "Yo, Google" would be so much better than boring "Hey, Google"
I can't believe they kicking to JR with Hood hooping like he is
KD deserves props today. Straight up carrying bums
Well, this is over
Goddamn KD is on fire
people would MURDER lebron or KD if they had 4 pts in a finals game
James finna lose his left eye and come back next year with an eye patch and average 40 15 15
to do that in the finals
Lebron: Fine, I'll do it myself
LEBRON TO LEBRON
AND ITS ONLY THE FIRST QUARTER
A lot of funny stuff so far. The Tmac by Lebron and then the ball bouncing off Currys face.
"You can't assist yourself!"
"Sure you can. He just did!"
“That’s fucking bullshit!” -Draymond Green, 2018
...when are Tristian Thompson and Draymond Green going to give up the pretense and start making out already? I've got slash-fics to make canon!
r/nba game threads should be renamed "bitch about the refs thread"
Damn Nance just pulled Draymond down, refs gotta see that
lol Why is that not over the back? These refs are shitting on Draymond lol
Crazy how in 30 seconds lebron goes from not being able to put weight on his ankle to running the fast break.
I'm so glad Jordan "300 Bricks a Minute" Clarkson isn't playing.
Every purge movie is literally the same thing just with different masks
I still can't believe LeBron actually got called for pushing off. Brb gonna buy a lotto ticket
Lol "2nd point blank layup he's miss", as if they were both uncontested
LeBron gotta be so demonstrative with his complaining
Is this some kind of plan to let Curry guard LeBron. Why is this happening?
That's 100% a charge on LeBron and I'm rooting for the Cavs
Warriors win
r/nba: "lol rigged"
Cavs have the lead in the first half
KD IS NOT NICE MY GOD
I hate that he moved to GS, but I can't deny the fact that the man can ball
Cavs are fucked they're playing good but still only up 6
what a killer lmao
Curry only has 2 points... and they are down 6.  This is fucking scary.
KD has carried this time. Cavs dominated if you ignore the score. They shouldn't be happy they're only up 6.
That Gabrielle Union commercial is so dumb... Like, why would this dude Gary think she's talking about him? Does he have pickles and melty melty cheese?
How the fuck do the Cavs have 0 free throws? Been driving it a lot too. Thought that was one on KD at the end of the qtr.
Paid $8 for in-flight WIFI
I can't even watch gamecasts
This is my nightmare, guess I'm catching the replay
Iggy sounds so old. "Didn't aggravate an old injury, he ran around and jumped a little and got a new injury."
Lol clear shove on Love there
Chicken is the MVP of the apple commercial
Ok the Lonzo commercial was good
That KD turnaround midranger is unguardable
Rodney Good is back. League fucked.
TIL Rodney Hood can play basketball
Don't see how that play by LeBron against Klay isn't an offensive foul. Dude just blatantly pushes him away.
Hood doesn't even need to be good, he just needs to not be Clarkson. And he's doing a great job at that tonight
So love dominates the first half barely touches the ball totally expected from Lue
Wow it's almost like Hood should've been playing this whole series.
Draymond shoots like 70% from the top of the key and 0% from every where else
Bruh JR on get ready for some of the dumbest shit you've seen since game 1
When are the Cavs gonna get Rodney Hood some help smh he gone
I get Curry is ice cold but why is Klay being ignored all 2nd half?
Great game guys. Enjoy it and stop complaining.
Ok Mark Jackson. Go replay that Curry drive so I can hear you talk about contact.
Hood's effort just forced a TO on Durant. Hood making big plays.
LeBron is so cold from three. He needs to drive every time, but that is so exhausting to do for a player, even one with inhuman endurance.
I'm sorry. But for the minutes he gets, JR Smith has been pitiful this series.
I hate Mark Jackson
Damn it's frustrating to watch the Cavs piss this away. Wide open bricks, not taking advantage of defensive mismatches, and not letting Hood keep working his hot hand when no one else seems to be shooting well...
This is one of Lebron’s worse triple dub game
I have a feeling that Curry is going to make a game winning 3. I know this makes no sense but I'm writing it in case it happens.
Lmao, what a shot. Rip cavs
LeBron basically just told the refs to change the call
Thats not a foul, holy shit
bogus call on curry
Hahaha dude is acting. They barely touched
LMAO my guy Larry took Dray to the ground
Lebron just did 3 months of recovery by tying his shoe lace tighter
The Purge is such a dumb idea. People would be way more incentivized to band together to protect their own neighborhoods, than they would be to roam around purging. In fact, the easiest targets would be the people participating. You see some jackass wander into your area with a shitty mask that says "God," and he gets dropped immediately.
Curry is having the worst night imaginable and GSW have a five point lead. Fade me now.
Kd with the fck you 3
KD a cold motha...
FUCKING GOAT DON'T @ ME
KD JUST MURDERED THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF CLEVELAND
my god...
Fuck yeah!
These refs play HQ, just trying to extend the series to get that big prize money.
People wanna act like they want NBA players that are bruisers and dicks, until its someone on a team they don't like.
nothing says "NBA Finals" quite like Rihanna's "work"
That's crazy that legitimately nobody other than Kevin Durant had a rebound for the Warriors in the entire first quarter
Lol Korver thought he was Curry
korver doesn't know what an efficient 2 is
I have to say it every time i see it: fuck facebook. Even that voice on the commercial is fucking annoying
Warriors fan here, but man i gotta give it to Kevin Love, totally attributing this game to him honestly, he is fierce this game, all over them offensive boards.
Lmao he missed the first shot in the series and straight to the bench he goes. Tough kerr
LeBron got more power after getting hurt. Super saiyan confirmed.
Starting to think Lebron‘s body is literally incapable of getting injured in any sort of capacity. Bet he doesn’t even get nosebleeds.
Jordan Bell literally just did the "jump to the side so it looks like you're playing defense" move.
Kevin Love inhaling rebounds like he’s thicc Wolves Love
“Is he close to the circle?”
“Yeah he’s by the free throw line”
“Alright trigger the review”
Can someone neutral explain to me how calls just get changed now?
When 3 of your all stars ain't playing well at least you have KD!
Why would you guard Livingston on the corner while Durant is going 1on1?
It FEEEELS like the refs are leaning in favour of Cavs on most 50/50 calls yet the FT disparity against them is as bad as I have ever seen.
I am LeConfused.
Glad hood is doing better than Jordan Clarkson's bum ass
KD is so goddamn good. 24/8 on 10 shots wtf
“We’re sorry”-Wells Fargo, Facebook
It’s crazy how many commercials are out right now apologizing for shady corporate business practices. IDC what you have to say, you wouldn’t be making any of these changes if you hadn’t gotten caught.
Is this an ugly glasses contest
dude Oscar from the office was probably pissed that cp's injury kept him out of that Final's money
I like Lonzo A LOT more after seeing him in these commercials
(Cavs being physical) Warriors fans: FUCKING REFS
(Warriors being physical) Cavs fans: FUCKING REFS
stop playing through JR
Golden State's leading scorers tonight:
Durant - 27
McGee - 10
feels a lot like the warriors are bout to run away with this....
Turns out George Hill on Durant is a bad switch
Lol why they following curry to the bathroom
Draymond is getting straight up murdered under the rim. No call from the refs......
Steph Curry is 1\-11 and they are up 2... god damn...
LeBron got a solid 1 minute of rest
I wonder if the refs regret the interactive Twitter account yet
Hood > Jordan ”Choking Hazard” Clarkson
This is eerily similar to Game 3 last year where the Warriors shit the bed and KD scored like 45 points in the 4th quarter to win.
What's lower - Steph's FG% tonight or Uncle Drew's Rotten Tomatoes % after it comes out?
Man steph has 4 points and we losin
Horrible foul call on Livingston
Curry is the reason the warriors havent blown this wide open.
Rodney hood is a pimp
Cavs blew an easy win in a bad KD game, but they absolutely have to take advantage of a bad Curry game
I'm a KD hater but I have to acknowledge that he's straight balling tonight.
Reason Hood haven't played until tonight is because Iggy is his man.
Imagine how this series would've been different if Rodney hood was in the rotation instead of clarkson
Klay throwing up some absolutely garbage shots tonight.
I dont get the Curry hate. im hoping the Cavs win but even the greats can have off nights damn
give it to Hood
Motherfucker these call Google ads need to be illegal
Imagine if Hood had been in Game 1
I just realized I hate all car commercials because they all remind me of the idiot drivers I have to deal with every day.
Win or lose, Hood had one hell of a game.
Fucking wow.clean.
man fuck this
HOLY SHIT KD
This sub is cancer
Yo Google, can you help Steph hit his shots
Steph Curry is shooting literally 7% from the field tonight and the Cavs are still struggling
KD ruined the NBA back on the menu boys
this will be known as the RED EYE series in bron's career
Adande: The game after Ray Allen set the Finals three-point record with 8, he went 0-for-8 from three. One game after Curry broke the record with 9 threes he is 0-for-9
Sports are weird.
I didn't realize these apple commercials came with a free LSD trip
> 69-69
*nice*
It's actually fucking insane that LeBron doesn't even seem affected by that ankle roll
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
Oh man that was so dirty.
k love dropping 50
Love seeing Kevin compete
"FUCK YEAH"
I really wish we pulled out game 1 :/
Now that’s a bullshit call
lol what kind of foul was that?
Wtf was that foul on curry. Softest call ever.
Dray does my head in with this selfish shit, just fucking once think of the team
Bro JVG spitting FAX
Did TT just box out two dudes?
White Boy Rick looks decent, but I feel like I watched the entire movie in that trailer.
Cavs having the most perfect game possible plus they are getting every little touch foul possible and they are only up 8. God damn
Lmao imagine if we get another Draymond game 5 suspension
that looked pretty weak tbh
What an embarrassing flop lmao
"Kyrie Irving was missed by the Cavs" No shit
There are seriously more Warriors Fans at the Q than Cavs fans. Disgusting.
I feel like in 2010 i didnt even know the warriors were a team
I just don't get how the Cavs lost their 3 point shot. Between Hill, Love, and JR it's been absolutely amazing how awful the playoffs have been (outside of the Toronto series).
I mean, just missing wide fucking open shots.
LeBron: 6/10. 60%.
Rest of team: 12/37. 32%.
Absolute joke.
I hate seeing everyone whine about how LeBron is quitting. The man is fucking exhausted.
The apathy on defense will never get old - I truly don’t get it. JR would be benched by any other coach for lazy rotations and effort.
This team is so good at beating themselves it’s amazing.
Why the fuck can't Jr pump fake a charging McGee?
shittiest most forgettable finals in a long, long time
I respect Nance so much, fighting till the very end. Great to see Bron back in too.
Lue finally benched JR when it no longer matters.
Damn the q seems so fucking dreary. Like everyone is somber. Seems like a ton of warriors fans too (relatively). This is what many people believe to be his last game as a cav. People need to stand the fuck up. It always seems like playoff/finals crowds suck as far as noise goes.
george hill missing more free throws. wtf
Ty Lue gives Rodney Hood a chance
It goes better than anyone could have expected
Ty Lue makes him disappear again
Literally no one besides Lebron and Kevin can score consistently on this team. And I’m being generous with kev.
Imagine being an NBA coach and deciding the matchup you wanted was JR defending Durant
LEBRON AS LONG AS YOU DONT INSTANTLY TAKE OFF YOUR JERSEY WHEN THIS GAME IS OVER I WONT CRY
I'd never believe Kevin Love took more shots than Lebron in an elimination game
I know this is dramatic but I swear if Lue is still coaching next year, I’m not watching.
i hate Igoudala's mom-stripper angel's wings tattoo
God they need to make these free throws! We would be up right now if they made them!!
I just can't watch these fucks celebrating on our court again
So this is how we're going down, huh? LeBron's last game at home and nobody is playing like their pride is on the line. Fucking shameful. We deserve to get swept if this is how we're playing on home court...
DREW CAREY IS THERE. Love that guy, seems like a awesome person.
Gg my friends. I'll see you all next season!
Fuck. Put in Cedi. Get him some play time.
Is Mark Jackson really talking about ADVERSITY regarding the Warriors? Fucking LOL
I wonder if durant will ever stop being fake tough. who exactly is he trying to impress? he never cussed in okc and now all of sudden he a bad boy. pls
Lol I'm already seeing a ton of ridicule and criticism being put on LeBron. It's actually insane. He's on pace for 30 points on 60% shooting with 10 assists all while having to create his entire team's offense for 48 minutes and people are saying he's checked out. No matter how well he plays, if his team loses people will find a way to twist the L into being on him.
Since his numbers are always so great, haters and entitled fans will use anything that isn't quantifiable against him even if it's the complete opposite of the truth. Game 2 against Boston he had a 40 point triple double but all I heard was talk about his 5 turnovers, that he isn't a good leader, that he's a worse defender than Harden and Curry (lol), that he's too ball dominant for his teammates to get into a rhythm, etc. And if that doesn't work they just fall back on the LeGM excuse. As if it's all his fault that a pathetic, mentally soft all time great player joined a team that was already in the running for GOAT team. God I'm so sick and tired of the NBA and its fanbase
I know Korver has sucked but there’s more to life than basketball
His fucking brother suddenly passed away this season. He gets a pass
Animojis make me want to throw my phone into the fucking tv
I have never hated apple more.
Klay Thompson barreled over jr
Warriors fans: not a fucking foul
You guys can't give up this early! There is plenty of game left
If Bron is going down, he will go down swinging. We just need those fucking open 3s to go down
Good shit, Love
Durant really is so soft
Damn, KD arguing with the ref there's a T. Last game Draymond won't shut his mouth and no T. Fuck this league.
It's like when a sick family member dies. Even though you're expecting it, it still hurts when they go...
Somebody get LeBron that Embiid mask
Gotta keep Nance this offseason
WHY THE FUCK DOES DURANT GET CALLED FOR EVERYTHING
They didn't want to call that 4th foul on Thompson
So what you are telling me is, TY Lue is taking out the successful lineup and putting in the non successful lineup? Got it....
Curry and Draymond have the biggest fucking egos in the league
Kyrie sitting courtside in his uncle drew makeup
lol gotta catch up on all the FTs we didn't get game 3
George hill out here shooting free throws like he can win a game
Hit fucking free throws
and instead of hustling chasing his own miss JR stands there like a Dumb F
Remember when Lebron used to shoot jumpers?
Pepperidge farm remembers
The warriors have great players, a great system, and a great coach. Wish the Cavs at least had a great coach
2015/2016 Finals were awesome and competitive. 2017 and 2018 have been  a dagger to the heart. So many what ifs, such is life as a Cavs fan.
LeBron out there playing his game with one eye, a bum ankle, no rest, and a standing triple team/illegal defense in the paint. Shut the fuck up. It's only the 1st half.
OH HELLO DREW CAREY
Lue is such trash as a coach. Our starting five was shitting itself all first half and he made NO changes
Lue has GOT to go. You can't motivate your team to care about a fucking elimination game? You're useless.
Just in guys! Cavs worse off without top 10 player in the league on their team.
Can't turn it off... could be the end of the greatest era in Cleveland sports (in my lifetime).
This is more boring than the 2007 sweep.
Bron should just go for Jordan's record tonight
Can’t wait until Ty Lue is gone.
Lebron is done
Good for the warriors. Glad to see a team come out of nowhere and surprise everybody
So if Bron leaves.. anyone looking forward to rooting for an underdog team again, with no pressure or drama? Could be fun.
Nance trying to show he's the future
Nance is a keeper.
#HireHinkie
Nance is defo a keeper
I hate that I'm kind of ready for it to be over. This season felt so long and torturous.
LeBron just wants to get through this game without getting hurt
Mods should ban these Warrior "fans" shitposting here
Does it kind of ruin basketball slightly for anyone else that it's a legitimate strategy to try and make people foul you? Like I get it and know we do it, but I just wish overall people would just fucking play. It's like people focus more attention on getting fouled than they do on getting a basket sometimes.
I'd congratulate the warriors but their fanbase is fucking cancer. Also fuck KD and Draymond.
Guys this might be our last game together so can yall fake be happy or something
Im excited to play some 2k after this game and lead this team to a championship
If there was ever a time for a Korver 27 pt explosion, this would be it
Glad to see the "this game is over" brigade has already arrived. /s
THE GAME IS NOT OVER.. WTF WRONG WITH SOME OF YOU?
MY MAN KEVIN LOVE WILL DROP BUCKETS WITH ONE WORKING HAND
Lmao everyone on this chat went from "it's over fuck this team" to "I love this team"
THAT LITERALLY HAPPENED TO GH THE PLAY BEFORE THESE REFS ARE MENTAL
Gosh I can't stand those warriors fans sitting behind their bench
Love looking like the only one that wants to win
The warriors sit Klay and still have a finals MVP filling in his role. This warriors team STACKED. sounds like im complaining but these are just FACTS.
Love is the only one who cares, fuck his haters I love this man
Stop making Predator movies.
Warriors look like the team facing elimination in this one ugh
finals-korver's been such a disappointment
LeBron gotta wear goggles
I think LeBron's eye is still bugging him. If his depth perception is messed up, it explains why he can't/won't shoot.
curry needs to stop with that ugly ass floppin after every 3, cheater
Glad curry isn't getting those bullshit fouls
When people say curry doesn't get calls, its cause he's ALWAYS flopping on the ground. It's fucking ridiculous how much he does it.
COCKY ASS CURRY..SOMEONE NEEDS TO KNOCK HIS EGO DOWN A FEW PEGS
stick with the bench ty lue they gave you the comeback smh
Make your fucking free throws
Alright. Bench George Hill. Dude is a deer in headlights.
I hate how people use the Houston series to justify that the NBA is just fine or whatever, this team is such bullshit man.
fuck these foul calls, stupid ass refs, kd jumped and flopped into him
If the NBA keeps trending in this direction we're gonna get to a point where free throws are so easy to get it won't be statistically worthwhile to play defense.
I demand shaq and chuck instead of these announcers.
James is not open, a guy in his face, when he drives another guy in the lane, he kicks out for the correct decision.
Lebron has become a victim of his own durability and iron man image. It has not occurred to anyone that he might be exhausted. That his ankle might actually be hurt. That GS is buiding a wall every time he touches the ball. That Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson being on the floor takes away his drivin lanes. Sheesh!
I think LeBron said couple times during the season, he doesn't like the FO trade Kyrie, doesn't like they trad D.Wade and other veteran guys. And look at how dumb the FO and boss are. They don't deserve LeBron. He is gone for sure
This could, for real, be the last time we see LeBron play as a Cavalier and y'all are really going to bash him and say he's QUITTING? He has put his whole body and health on the line for this fucking team all post season. He has played every fucking game. He has done everything that he can. I don't care if we lose, I am grateful. Grateful to witness the king, grateful for everything he's done for us. And you should all be grateful too.
I’d rather the Cavs win any day, but at this exact minute if LeBron leaving is more than media-made crap and he’s actually out, I’m cool with it. He broke the curse. I’d rather he solidify his legacy and finally take down this disgrace of a powerhouse team in GSW with a team that can do it.
Again, I’d rather a Cleveland franchise win any day. But given reality, that’s where I’m at.
WTF REFS HE DIDN’T EVEN BREATHE ON THAT BALL
Commentators talking like the warriors aren't clearly superior
Jr has been the biggest let down put in hood
# time to show off the next generation Cavalier
cedi osman
Lue is such a dog shit coach. Elimination game and you start the same dweebs in the 3rd who put you in a hole the first half
Shaping up to be a classic game where we cut it to 5 midway through 4th and then get blown out
I want Kyrie back
LeBron now gonna talk shit about this team after this game and I'll love it.
Mark Jackson can shove a rusty pike up his ass. Acting like LeBron hasn't shown up.
That's not a charge wtf? He's on the restricted area
JR or Helen Keller in a 3pt contest?
JR should've never played after game 1 yet here we are. Still riding with JR all the way to a sweep
Hood buries a 3, Cavs then run 3 3pt actions for JR Smith lmao.
Let Cedi get some run
It will be refreshing to start over and have no expectations.
We could have gotten PG for kyrie but the pacers GM fucked us
Well boys it's going to be an interesting off season. Whatever happens, I hope to see you all next year.
fuck golden state.
Kyle 'Deron Williams' Korver.
Kyle Korver is the player I am most disappointed in.
The only player I care about keeping besides LBJ is Larry
damn korver lmao
mark jackson actually said something correct for once.
if bron stays we have to change
Ghill would be an excellent back up  guard
LeBron will leave bc he's a competitor.  He's not going to just take this sweep and a 1-8 record against these Warriors the last two years.  He's going to put himself in a real winning situation and he knows that's not happening in Cleveland.  He's going to leave to compete and we should all support him in the fight wherever he goes.
Can’t believe Curry is about to tie LeBron in rings
that kyrie commentary was the dumbest thing I have ever heard
Did you guys read the story of the Warrior Lifers? Known as the “original Warriors fans,” these 11 friends claim to have been Warriors fans since all the way back in 2009. They get together and watch upwards of 3 games per year and are subject to massive ridicule in the Bay Area as most Bay residents believe that Warriors franchise formed in 2014.
“We weren’t born yesterday,” said Oakland resident Alan Cove, “these guys go around telling stories about how Klay Thompson was drafted in 2011 and how they saw it on TV and knew the name because Klay’s dad used to play too!”
“I’m just tired of all the attention these idiots get,” said another Bay Area resident, “The Warriors were around in 2009? Right, and I’m the king of Siam!”
Many who were shown data to suggest the Golden State Warriors came to fruition in 1971 responded with continued, aggressive, disbelief.
Would be so sweet if all the Warriors fans who bought their way into the Q to see the "sweep" go home empty handed
lol hack across the arm. Refs know where their money is
When kd isos why doesn’t TT double him and leave draymond open at the 3 ? Rather have him shoot open 3s then kd shooting contested shots smh
Lebron deserves so much more than this team of rejects
Kevin Love has 2 defensive modes: matador and doormat
we have 0 stops, and not hitting at the other end, actually some open shots.
god this apple commercial is torturous
They can't even try enough to at least make this competitive. Cavs got raptored. Game 1 ruined them
I don't want to see no passive shit from Lebron today
Fucking seriously
Unreal. Just unfair
That's a foul too. Thanks refs
WAIT WHO HAS A TECH? JVG JUST SAID THERE WAS A TECH BUT NEVER SAID WHO. PLEASE BE DRAY.
Great defence from TT.
If I ever see Kevin Durant in real life, I’ll offer him a comb and then be like “jk lol”
Why did Durant get a tech, on a plane with no TVs rn
Im not even stressed tonight. I'm just appreciating LeBron.
JR smith lost KEVIN FUCKING DURANT on an in bounds play. Jesus Christ...
It feels like Love is the only one who cares
Despite the probable outcome of this series Kevin Love has at least done a good job. I'm proud of him for doing his thin at least. If Lebron leaves he deserves to be dealt to a good team. Can probably get a first rounder + good young players out of him too.
I hope kev has like a 41 point game
Hood has impressed me so much these last two games
At least Hood seems like he's all-in.
People wanna bitch about Bron but all of these Warriors players bitch and moan after throwing the most obvious fouls
KD obvisiously yelled out something really nasty.
Seriously just seems like LeBron is like "Whatever man, this season is finally over thank goodness" .
Oh, so *NOW* the refs try to help us? Where the fuck was this kind of officiating back in game 3?
Bron stays, Love and Smith traded away for PG3, Kyrie hits free agency and resigns with Cavs.  Cavs in 5 2019
My niggas what happened to Korver? He was great in the regular season and playoffs but is missing shots that he would normally make in this series. Same thing happened last year too. These are open looks as well
I'm going miss this man so fucking much :')
Fast Break Points whaaaaa?
Love how they’re sticking on Curry when he tries to get to the corner.
Warriors don't kick nuts any more they poke eyes now
#GOT THE LEAD
So proud of this team. They came together so late in the season and had such little time to truly mesh as players. This is kind of a re-hash of the 2015 finals, where we were such a new team, and only the strength of Lebron got us into the finals.
This team has shown a lot of grit. Green, Hill, Nance, and Hood have really shown themselves to be worthy of being on our team. I'm not counting us out of this, because you always have a chance when Lebron is on your team, but I'm really looking forwards to the finals next year, when we can have a whole season to mesh.
Hell of a season, Hell of a ball club. Wish Lebron the best wherever he ends up next season (though I really wish he stays!).
Curry is twisting his body to sell a foul
Curry out here doing the most tryna draw fouls smfh. Worst part is they're gonna start calling them eventually...
Positive that we’re on a run after a strong start for the Warriors.
How do we have the lead?  That's impossible.
Yeah we call that flopping JVG lmao
LeBron needs some Horace Grant goggles
#14-4 IN THE QUARTER WE'RE DOING IT
How the fuck is this team so stupid on defense?
Take Jr out. He's sorry
Take the starters out...fuck!
We're gonna lose on missed FTs again aren't we
Tfw the bench plays the Warriors better than the starters
Please give me Calderon over George hill. He does nothing on either end.
Wtf was that crazy 3 pter from curry
I can't believe what I am seeing this is bad.
Hill garbage.
JR garbage
another free throw miss?  the hell?
HILL IF YOU MISS ANOTHER DAMN FREE THROW, you should’ve been practicing free throws until your wrist broke after game 1
Put the bench back in. At least they play with energy.
10-16 from the line. Woof.
Ty lue is such as bad coach . Hood is finally playing like we've wanted but now he's still on the bench for Jr .
Bench unit gets a lead, and what does Ty Lue do?
Promptly pull the bench unit.
Jr has gotten blocked like three times now
I might turn this garbage off
Making captain rattail look like a hall of famer this series.
Love with the swift 2/10.
You know your team is stacked when you have an athletic 7footer and don't use him often.
Can the team learn how to stop McGee rolling to the basket?
Of course they would make a last second three on us... Back to 9 good job... Wow
Im wondering why Bron has went away from the post fadeaway...
We need to play defensive minded players like Cedi.
We are not gonna outshoot this team from 3
I just knew they would make that shot...smh
We can't win this game . I always feel like we're trying to become champions but we're giving less effort and are less talented
Hill and Jr are washed. I think TT had played better come playoffs but the dude has no skill
Is this it? Is this how the Cavs are gonna go out?
I hate the warriors
So who do we try to get to replace Lue?
I just miss so much having a team with good defense. Hope we hire a good coach at that this offseason for once.
What are these fouls?
Well, theres two quick BS ones for GSW
3 fouls in 57 secs like wtf
WHAT THE FUCK
Get ready because our stupid coach will return from this timeout with the same shit lineup
Ty Lue’s final game thank god
George Hill can't defend without foul, can't score on Curry iso, can't pass the ball without turning over, and can't make a foul shot.
Ty Lue has that Marvin Lewis clueless  gaze look to him.
TAKE. HILL. OUT.
George Hill is so trash lmao the 19 million dollar man
That was literally worse than LeBron’s call in game 1 lmao
bruh I just don't wanna have no basketball to watch anymore
Bron gotta literally baby this team for them to win lol.
Hood is needed right now. Hill and JR struggling on O. But Lue is the coach so that won’t happen.
JR is the biggest fucking idiot in the fucking league
Smith is the dumbest player in the NBA by far.
OH WHAT A SURPRISE, HOOD PROVIDES MORE THAN HILL. FUCK YOU LUE
WHAT IS GOOD IN THE RODNEY HOOD
Why wasn't hood playing god fucking damnit
can these guys at least act like theyre trying
BENCH JR TF
Games over, LeBron needs to just take every shot for the rest of the game, I wouldn’t be mad
I am convinced Lue and JR have an affair
Whatever team Lebron is on next year I hope they fucking PRACTICE
How is JR still in the game? I don't get it.
Terrible way to go out... No fight what so ever
This feels just like Boston's game in 2010
Thing that bothers me most they are gonna celebrate on our home floor
Out hustled. End the game.
LeBron should just foul out, he's getting no calls
Ty Lue cannot remain coach of this team
Bron has checked up fellas. He did all he could. GS literally planned around him and forced others to show up and they didnt
Lmao @ Mark Jackson talking about KD not quitting
Its 6 am here, and it is really painful to watch my team like this.....
Lebron just shoot it every time!
Just fire Lue during the break, I'm so mad rn
At least Fortnite is coming to the Nintendo switch
Idc what anyone says the past 4 years have been awesome
It's been a fun season guys! See y'all soon!
I love Kyle but he’s been the worst player on the floor this series. taking idiotic contested shots off the dribble and missing all of them, terrible in the pick and roll game and the off ball screen game, and when he actually closes out he fouls every single time. stupid fouls on 3 point shots. just terrible
Korver needs to retire
Hood is making Lue look so bad lmaoo
If LeBron stays, we need a scoring PG, and another wing, at the least
Bron is trying not to get hurt at this point. It's been 12 minutes since his last drive.
Can curry ever make a three without acting like a fucking tool
Low key feel like curry wants to have a really good game so he can snatch the FMVP from Durant
Regardless of what happens, TT has really shown his value at times in the Playoffs.
This just in: Team with two top five players and four top 15 players is good. How fun.
How many times has Klay’s stupid ass gotten that call? And he wants to bitch. I fucking hate the warriors.
I'm still loling from Draymond's air ball
Curry wants finals mvp so bad that hes trying to outplay KD but its costing them lol
Iggy rubs me the wrong way
James is shooting 60% with 5 dimes.  He may end up with 30+.  Don't get the complaints...
I hate Durant
12 shots for LeBron?
In an elimination game?
Curry the type of dude to miss 7 straight threes and do a stupid celebration when he finally makes one like he never missed the previous ones.
Since they'll never give it to Bron, McGee should be finals MVP. The entire series changed the moment he stepped onto the court.
Lebron looks like he’s trying to protect his fg% out there
If cavs lost 4-1 with a proven superstar next to Lebron last year. Why did anyone think they had a chance this year?
I hate klay
I hate the donkey
My (warriors fan) friend texted me because hes at the game and i yelled at him and said " you better enjoy this damn moment cause you might never go to the finals or win a championship ever again in your lifetime. Get off yo damn phone"
And then i realized he will just become a fan of whoever is winning at that time lmao
The Cavs have the worst home officiating than any team I’ve ever watched lol
This is just... boring. Foregone conclusion. Pretty much exactly what Bill Burr discussed in his rant about KD on the Warriors
that was a foul on KD
Very bad defense
Creepy Alien head singing Childish Gambino
Well, this could be it. It's been a pleasure watching the Cavs in 4 straight finals.
Thanks for the 4 years LeBron.  Best wishes wherever you decide to go.
Those LeBron stats just scream "they can't be mad at me if I leave because I literally gave it my all this year"
Lebron can’t be passive; trying to getting people involved. Go get 50 and let them follow.
I love this team
Kevin Love you are deep in the Q.
DWIGHT SHRUTE IS IN A MOVIE!!
What's up with the music? Trying to put us to sleep.
Is it my illusion, or the Cavs are trying to make Curry the FMVP? That turnover from LeBron was unreal, so bad.
I didn’t have high expectations going into this game but I’m already disappointed
Yep, LeBron's checked out
I hope these finals have terrible ratings.
It feels like Love is the only one who cares
Kevin Love's been great in this series tbh, it's just a shame we haven't had a more consistent third option behind him
I’m not trying to pile on to the jr hate but he really only has one move when he drives lol that floater
Man these Warriors... double KD and he’ll pass it to another MVP/great shooter, don’t double him and KD shoots over everyone.
Cavs defense is the worst I have ever seen in the finals.
If Iggy and green are making 3s were fucked
That some great hustle but just gotta finish those. Nice defence on Curry though.
Guys, these Browns are looking damn good.
the fuck refs???????????? they cant see shit
People bitchin about Bron...he has 8 points that quarter. It's what you want isn't it?
LMAO they cut away from the woman with the bad teeth so fast. I loled
Can somebody shove a cock in Jacksons mouth
lebron hit in the eye again, and it's not even healed yet smdh fuck you warrirors and refs
Hood was playing too good for lue to keep him in...gotta play jr smh
Did bron really just get poked in the eye again.
I can’t even look at Draymond without my blood boiling
For a winning team they sure don't care if they ruin someone's career.  Mind them, we got nothing to lose. Maybe we should start doing the same reckless moves like them.
Win or lose I want to see us get more physical with these assholes before the series ends
Lebron just needs to think of Jeff green like he does TT when it involves throwing it to him open for a 3.
We got this, believe your team, believe your king
Loving the crowd rn!
when we play like this..man it makes that game 1 loss so hard
Big ups to the crowd. Love the energy
If we lose and KD doesn't do much tonight, will they really give KD finals MVP for having 1 horrible game, 2 average games and 1 excellent game?
Warrior bandwagoners will tell you Curry is flopping embarrassingly bc his ankles smfh. Just shoot you pathetic fuck!!!
Steph would be a pro at Twister
Kevin Durant didn’t understand the ending to Infinity War
Kyl3 Korver with the lockdown D
Steph you ain't Harden so stop Shaqtinafool
goddamn are the warriors fans in the /r/nba thread whiny ass bitches.  Both teams got favorable home calls.  Warriors wouldn't have won game 1 otherwise
Goddamn I love Larry
Why don't they fucking talk on defense
GS fans re crying and think Curry got clearly fouled on that last play. he didn't even get touched fucking obnoxious.
Lue sucks. Love was hot in the first quarter. Why has he been sitting for so long?
These calls are so one sided lebron clearly got fouled but you want to call a weak ass foul for KD fuck these refs
I think this would be a series if the Cavs could play any defense whatsoever
Starters back in and we back to sucking
Offensive foul lead to a 5 pt swing just like that... Thank u swish tho
those free throws must go in cavs come on
Good call Lue, bench the bench players who got you tied up and put in the starters who have played like crap.
Cedi save us.
What this team needs is a coaching overhaul. A coach that knows how to play defense and has offensive sets instead of pure Iso
That toss was so bad should have just given the Warriors the ball instead
besides bron, you can't depend on the cavs lineup for shit in this finals
We are still gonna win this game.
George hill defense on curry is atrocious, either leave him wide open and makes other teammates cover him or gets beaten one on one and curry gets to the paint. His free throw is shit, can't even make his "not clutch" ones. 0-3 fg 0-2 3pt.
I’m not even mad, just disappointed.
I wish LeBron had a game where he put up like 40 shots.
Drew wit dat piece
At least Drew came out
Dear God
The fuck?!??!
What a fucking ridiculous call
Baaaaaahahahaha this foul biz is fucking ridiculous
What the fuck are these calls
That's not a foul
George Hill is so trash
George hill is so overpaid...19 million a year for this
Isn't that a kick ball lmao
Play Calderon and Cedi. Fuck it
i mean to have 4 all stars and the luck is some bullshit
JR has been magnificent this game
